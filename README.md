City Scape is a colorscheme inspired by the neon signs on big cities, that's pretty
much it lmao.


## Features

Night City currently lacks a lot of features that more robust colorschemes have, like
plugin integrations... etc. Those will come as I deem necessary or as people request.

## Installation

Install with your favorite plugin manager

- Packer

```lua
use "zSnails/cityscape.nvim"
```

- VimPlug

```vim
Plug 'zSnails/cityscape.nvim'
```
